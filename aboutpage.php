                One of the important functions of post secondary institutions is research. In 2016
                Universities consisting of over 100 full-time teaching staff employed over 45,000

                staff involved in research [<cite><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/"><i>1</i></a></cite>].
                Students of post secondary institutions are encouraged to participate in academic research by working with a professor who would

                be their supervisor[<cite><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/
science/undergraduate/research/how_to_start"><i>2</i></a></cite>]. Supervisors provide support and mentoring to students so
                that they can complete their research and publish their findings.

                One of the key steps in academic research is the student’s choice of supervisor.
                To students that are just beginning to engage or who are furthering their

                research, this can be an overwhelming issue. Without a supervisor to help guide
                them, students hoping to pursue research are often unable to apply for grants, and
                may become dissuaded from attempting to apply to because many application sites
                are outdated poorly maintained [<cite><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/provost/TLFC"><i>3</i></a></cite>].
                Finding a supervisor with relevant abilities, background, and research interest increases the chances that academic
                collaboration will benefit the student and supervisor. Often, researching professors publish

                in areas that differ from their academic credentials, or the scope of their current
                research differs significantly from their formal training. This discrepancy can often
                result in a mismatch of the abilities and interests of the students who approach
                them. Information about professors can be found on their personal pages and their
                publications can also be searched for but, the information can be out of date or
                incorrect [<cite><a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~ualim/"><i>4</i></a></cite>].
                What our project will do is create a crowdsourced database which would allow
                users to record professor’s competencies, background,and research interests and
                publications. At the same time the database would be moderated by specified
                users to minimize inaccuracies and avoid slanderous accusations [<cite><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/academic/news/"><i>5</i></a></cite>].
